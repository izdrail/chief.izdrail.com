# Chief PRD One-Shot Generator

You are an expert product manager. Your task is to generate a comprehensive `prd.md` file based on a high-level project name and description.

## Project Name
{{NAME}}

## User Description
{{DESCRIPTION}}

## Your Task

Create a `prd.md` file at `{{PRD_DIR}}/prd.md` with a structured PRD. 

## PRD Format Requirements

The `prd.md` MUST follow this exact structure to be compatible with conversion:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Overview
[A detailed overview of the project based on the user's description]

## User Stories

### US-001: [Meaningful Title]
**Priority:** 1
**Description:** As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

### US-002: [Meaningful Title]
**Priority:** 2
...
```

## Guidelines

1. **Be Comprehensive**: Expand the user's brief description into a full set of requirements.
2. **Break down the feature** into at least 3-5 small, implementable user stories.
3. **Prioritize stories** - start with the core functionality.
4. **Include clear acceptance criteria** - specific and testable.
5. **Quality implementation**: Include stories for setup, testing, or documentation if appropriate.

Write the `prd.md` file to `{{PRD_DIR}}/prd.md` now using your tools.
