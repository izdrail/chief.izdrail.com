# Chief Documentation Website

## Overview

A VitePress documentation site for Chief, hosted on GitHub Pages at `izdrail.github.io/chief`. The site includes a stunning landing page and comprehensive documentation explaining how Chief works, with a Tokyo Night-inspired dark theme and Tailwind CSS styling.

## Goals

- Provide a beautiful, modern landing page that explains what Chief is and why developers need it
- Document the complete PRD → Ralph loop workflow with clear diagrams
- Offer a full CLI reference generated from the codebase
- Enable easy sharing of docs with LLMs (copy as markdown, open in Claude/ChatGPT)
- Deploy automatically via GitHub Actions

## Key Messages

The documentation should emphasize Chief's core philosophy:

1. **Single binary, zero dependencies** - Drop it on any machine and it works
2. **All state in `.chief/`** - Portable, self-contained, nothing global
3. **Works anywhere** - Local dev machine or remote server, same experience
4. **Simple core** - The loop is ~80 lines, easy to understand and debug
