# PRD: Chief TUI - Autonomous Agent Loop for PRDs

## Introduction

Chief is a TUI application that orchestrates Claude Code to work through Product Requirements Documents autonomously. It wraps an agent loop with monitoring, controls, and a delightful developer experience. Users write PRDs describing features, and Chief invokes Claude repeatedly until all user stories are complete.

*Named after Chief Wiggum, Ralph Wiggum's dad from The Simpsons. Inspired by [snarktank/ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph).*

The core value proposition: transform a PRD into working code with minimal human intervention, while providing visibility and control over the process.

## Goals

- **Delightful DX**: Make monitoring and controlling the agent loop a pleasure with a modern, keyboard-driven TUI
- **Easy Distribution**: Single binary with no dependencies, cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **Simple Core**: The agent loop should be ~80 lines, easy to understand and debug
- **Self-Contained**: Embed the agent prompt, PRD skills, and completion sound in the binary
- **Autonomous Execution**: Claude works through stories one at a time, updating state as it goes
- **Recovery**: Handle interruptions gracefully; resume where left off

## User Stories

### Phase 1: Core

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Initialize Go module at `github.com/minicodemonkey/chief`
- [ ] Add Bubble Tea, Lip Gloss, and Bubbles dependencies
- [ ] Create directory structure: `cmd/chief/`, `internal/loop/`, `internal/prd/`, `internal/tui/`, `internal/notify/`, `embed/`

## Functional Requirements

- **FR-01**: Chief must invoke Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions -p <prompt> --output-format stream-json --verbose` flags
- **FR-02**: Chief must parse stream-json output line by line and extract: assistant text, tool calls, tool results
- **FR-03**: Chief must detect `<chief-complete/>` in Claude's output to know when all stories are done
- **FR-04**: Chief must re-read prd.json after each iteration to check for completion
- **FR-05**: Chief must log all raw Claude output to `.chief/prds/<name>/claude.log`
- **FR-06**: Chief must watch prd.json for external changes and update the TUI in real-time
- **FR-07**: Chief must support pausing (after current iteration) and stopping (immediately) the loop
- **FR-08**: Chief must handle interrupted sessions by detecting `inProgress: true` stories on startup
- **FR-09**: Chief must convert prd.md to prd.json automatically, preserving progress when possible
- **FR-10**: Chief must play a completion sound when all stories pass or max iterations reached
- **FR-11**: Chief must support multiple PRDs in `.chief/prds/` directory with switching between them
- **FR-15**: Chief must support running multiple PRDs in parallel, each with its own Claude process
- **FR-12**: Chief must work on terminals as narrow as 80 columns with graceful layout adaptation
- **FR-13**: Chief must build as a single static binary with no runtime dependencies
- **FR-14**: Chief must support darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, linux/amd64, linux/arm64, windows/amd64

## Non-Goals

- **Branch management**: Users handle git themselves; Chief does not create or switch branches
- **Headless/CI mode**: Not needed for v1; TUI is the primary interface
- **Settings persistence**: CLI flags are sufficient; no config file
- **Cost tracking**: Not tracking API usage or costs in v1
- **Web UI**: Terminal-only for v1
- **Team/multiplayer mode**: Single user only
- **Subagent monitoring**: Not tracking Task tool spawns in v1
- **Automatic retry on error**: User decides whether to retry; loop stops on error

## Design Considerations

### TUI Layout
- Two-panel dashboard: Stories list (left, ~40%), Details (right, ~60%)
- Full-screen log viewer as alternate view
- Modal overlays for: PRD picker, help
- Header always visible with state and timing
- Footer always visible with context-sensitive shortcuts

### Color Palette
| Element | Color | Hex |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Primary accent | Cyan | `#00D7FF` |
| Success | Green | `#5AF78E` |
| Warning | Yellow | `#F3F99D` |
| Error | Red | `#FF5C57` |
| Muted text | Gray | `#6C7086` |
| Border | Dim gray | `#45475A` |

### Status Indicators
| Symbol | State | Color |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `▶` | In progress | Cyan |
| `✓` | Completed | Green |
| `○` | Pending | Muted gray |
| `✗` | Failed | Red |
| `⏸` | Paused | Yellow |

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- **Bubble Tea**: TUI framework
- **Lip Gloss**: Styling
- **Bubbles**: Common TUI components (list, viewport, etc.)
- **fsnotify**: File watching
- **oto**: Cross-platform audio

### File Structure
```
.chief/
└── prds/
    ├── main/
    │   ├── prd.md          # Human-readable (source of truth)
    │   ├── prd.json        # Machine-readable (auto-generated)
    │   ├── progress.md     # Implementation notes
    │   └── claude.log      # Raw Claude output
    └── <other-prds>/
```

### State Management
- All persistent state lives in prd.json
- TUI model is ephemeral; reconstructs from prd.json on startup
- Loop state: Ready → Running → Paused/Complete/Error

### Error Recovery
- Non-zero Claude exit: show error, let user retry
- `inProgress: true` on startup: show warning, auto-resume on start
- File system errors: show error, don't crash

## Success Metrics

- User can go from `chief new` to running loop in under 2 minutes
- Loop correctly completes all stories in a test PRD without human intervention
- TUI remains responsive during Claude execution (no blocking)
- Binary size under 15MB
- Works on all target platforms without modification

## Design Decisions

1. **Multiple PRDs in parallel**: Yes — users can run multiple PRDs simultaneously, managed through the TUI. Each PRD has its own loop instance. The PRD picker shows real-time status of all PRDs.
2. **Dry run mode**: No — not needed; users can inspect the PRD to see what's next.
3. **progress.md format**: Freeform markdown — human-friendly, Claude writes it naturally.
4. **Schema validation**: No — trust the conversion process; if prd.json is invalid, Claude will fail with a clear error.
